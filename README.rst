web2cms - web2py-based CMS
==========================

:Author: Samuele Santi <samuele@santi.co.it>

This projects goal is to build a Content Management System based on
web2py_.

Many of the logic and terms come from the Drupal_ CMS, since I worked
for some years with it and I still like its CMS/framework structure
a lot, even though I don't like PHP anymore.

More information is contained in the ``doc`` directory, in form of Sphinx
reStructuredText files + compiled HTML.
