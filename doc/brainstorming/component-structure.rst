This page describes how components should be structured and work. 

What components should be able to do
====================================

* Add new content types, with custom fields, management, visualization, ..
* Extend existing content types, by adding fields
  * New fields should then be included in the views too
* Define blocks
* Create new controllers
* Create "content views" to display content with a custom render
* Extend the menu to attach new items
